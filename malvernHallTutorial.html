           While studying the painting of John Constable I became intrigued by some
           similarities in my attitude to photography and his to painting. For many 
           years Constable never referred to himself as a painter. Until he produced 
           this image known as <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable/malvern-hall">Malvern Hall</a>
         </p>. This was his breakout piece and after this he saw himself more and more as a <painter>
         <p>It is understandable that I would want to explore this iamge and to create my 
            own interpretation of it. This farm is located in a rural area near Victoria BC addition
            when I saw recongnized the potential it contained. 
         </p>
         <p>My initial intent was to capture as much by exposing the image to the right 
            of the histogram, but not blow out the hightlights. With digital sensors fifty percent
            of the resolution is taken up by the top twenty percent of the brightness, the right hand
            side of the histogram.

           Once I had the capture and had completed basic raw adjustments decisions were needed
           on how to finallize the image. Several techniques were tried but I settled on 
           subtractive editing. This techneque is achieved by taking a large brush, moving 
           the exposure to the lowest point and then brushing over the whole image. This effectively
           covers the image with a dark layer. At his point you take and eraser brush and
           start removing the black overlay. This needs to be done slowly with constant evaluation
           of where the iamge is and where it is going. You can try this several times and each
           time it will be slightly different. Once you have the effect you want stop and make any
           minor global adjustments that might be needed.
