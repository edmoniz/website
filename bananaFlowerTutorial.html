           This image was captured in Singapore and is an example of accepting what you have. Given 
           the location and equipment I had available could not get any closer to the banana flower. 
           So I used a Canon 20d with an 8mgPixel sensor and a Canon L Series One 100 to 400mm telephoto for
           the capture.

            With the available structue I planned to use the black part of the stem as an anchor
            and the brighter area behind as a contrast element. This bright area provided
            the main lighting for the flower.

           The final edited image shows that even with an 8mgPixel image a significant
           amount of enlargement can be achieved. The enlargement does contribute to 
           the soft look of the image but it is sharp where it needs to be on the stamins.
           Dark areas on the left and right create a good contrast to the lighter flower
           uppper background. This image was awarded an "Accepted" at a PPOC National Salon.
