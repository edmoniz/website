           If you watch to the Ansel Adams videos on the Resorces page you will

       hear him refer to "Visualizaition". This was a strong part of Ansel's skill,
           his ability to look at a scene in front of hme and visualize the final print.

            That technique was used here to capture this image and to allow flexibilty
            during editing. Knowing that the two Y shapes would be a key element it was
            necessary to leave enough room around them. This a key concept, not to over crop 
            in camera to leave yourself room to work during editing. Again here the image was
            exposed to the right and the original image has a slight over exposure look to it.

           This image did not require a significant amount of post editing. Simple black and 
           white conversion, cropping, global adjustments and some minor local editing for hightlghts.
