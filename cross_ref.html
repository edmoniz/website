  <h2>Web Page Development for Non-profit Organization or Small Businesses</h2>
  <h3>Purpose/Objective</h3>
  <p>
    This project is designed to give you the opportunity to apply the skills you are developing in this course by creating a demonstration website that addresses some needs of a non-profit organization or small business of your choice. (You are not contacting a real non-profit organization or business, but instead are building the website based on their potential needs and the criteria listed below.) Most organizations or businesses have a web presence to promote their products and services, and attract customers. An organization or business may have varying website needs. For the purposes of this assignment, we have set criteria that the website you design needs to be meet in order for you to successfully complete this project. You can use this website as a demonstration of your skills in an online portfolio, but first, you need to submit a project proposal to your Open Learning Faculty Member.
  </p>

  <h3>Proposal</h3>
  <p>
    Project Proposal was submitted and feedback from Open Learning Faculty Member was received before starting the project.
  </p>

  <h3>Factors for Success</h3>
  Some critical factors for success to keep in mind as you work on your project are:

  <ul>
    <li>
      A positive attitude about learning by doing. This is the single most important factor. If you
      believe that you can learn web design like you learn history (in other words, by listening to
      someone talk or by reading a book), then you will likely miss critical aspects of web design
      that can only be attained by actively doing it. Nonetheless, you need to understand the
      appropriate terminology and approaches to designing a website, so a combination of
      learning by doing and reading is important.
    </li>
    <li>
      Willingness to explore, especially online. Just about everything you need to create a successful product can be found on the Web. There are examples you can reference, graphics you can download, and more. If you are not motivated to explore, you will likely hand in a mediocre product. This course will help guide you to initial resources.
    </li>
  </ul>




<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This project's goal is to help you to improve in the areas described below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Communication -</strong> Develop verbal, listening, writing, and reading skills.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Research -</strong> Develop information on an actual organization.
    Use the Internet, resource books, and other research techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Positive Professional Attitude -</strong> Demonstrate an understanding of a company's needs. Work to meet established goals.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Work Ethic -</strong> Schedule time and resources to meet timelines.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Creativity -</strong> Use a broad scope of creativity in modelling a non-profit organization or business, and generating an application.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Business Skills -</strong> Gain insight into a functioning non-profit or business operation. Complete a prototype as part of your portfolio, ready to present to a real non-profit organization or business. Simulate a process similar to that of a consultant. Focus on simplicity, functionality, and ease of navigation within the website as they are key and critical factors to be kept in mind when completing this project.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Problem Solving and Troubleshooting -</strong> Isolate and solve application problems in code, design, and development.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Monitoring Your Progress -</strong> You should create a timeline for the completion of the various activities toward the completion of this project. Keep a copy of your timeline displayed where you can regularly review it and monitor your progress. The effectiveness of your plan will determine the proficiency and success of your completion of the web project.
  </li>
</ul>

<section>
  <h3>Cross Reference Page</h3>
  <p>
    As you near completion of the non-profit or small business website, include a web page that links to all requirements. This will help the Open Learning Faculty Member mark your website. Now is a good time to begin that web page by creating a list of all requirements, along with when they must be completed. Link this cross-reference web page to the project website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each item on the cross-reference page must be a hyperlink to the associated item within the website and include a description of what the link is going to show. Your website must demonstrate the appropriate, relevant, and functional use of each of the required features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cross-reference page must be accessible from the home page of the non-profit or small business website. It must be part of the project website. The cross-reference page should be the last thing you complete. Add the link to the extreme right of your navigational menu.
  </p>

  <h3>The cross-reference page should include the following:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Nine websites</li>
  <li>Minimum Requirement Features</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Demonstration Evaluation Form</li>
  <li>Each of these are explained below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2.2 Minimum Requirement Features</h3>
<p>
  The minimum requirement features include HTML5, CSS3, web form, multimedia, JavaScript, and responsive design. See the following deliverables table for more details.
