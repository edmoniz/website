<h2 id="topOfPage">Lightroom Tips</h2> 
<h3>by Edward Moniz</h3>  
<p>Lightroom is an effective tool for the management, raw conversion and basic 
editing of images. Currently at version 6/7, the program has gone through 
numerous changes, and with each latest version the addition of many exciting 
features. While the program will never replace Photoshop, you can produce 
presentation ready prints and digital images with it. This article will 
present several useful tips to help everyone get the most from the program.</p>

<p>The following are representative of the most frequent questions asked about Lightroom:</p>
<p><strong>What has Lightroom done with my images?</strong> This is without a doubt the most common question. The answer (drum roll in the background); exactly what you told it to do. Contrary to popular myth Lightroom doesn't do anything mysterious with your images. Lightroom does not import your images into itself, they always remain on your hard drive. Where will depend on the instruction you gave. If they are already on your hard drive and you use the "Add" command they will still be there. If you use the "Copy" option, then they will be placed in the folder you selected in the destination panel of the import dialog box. In either case your file will be on your hard drive with the physical address of where it is located on your hard drive stored in the Lightroom database / catalog, why Adobe chose to use the word catalog rather than database is a mystery. To use Lightroom effectively you should have a good understanding of your computer's operating system and how to create, navigate and manages folders. Users of Mac's will typically use the Finder app and Windows users explorer. If you are not comfortable and totally conversant with your computers filing system, it would be a good idea to take a class or workshop on operating system basics. Learning these fundamental skills will make using Lightroom and any other computer program easier.

   <strong>My computer has crashed, where are my images?</strong> While not a Lightroom specific issue it is one critical to effective photo management. Computer hardware is destined to fail. If you've never faced a hard drive failure, you have been lucky. A good backup methodology is extremely important. You need to create a backup copy of your files on an external device and store it and store it in a safe place. Given the number and size of photographic images a NAS (network attached storage) drive is an effective solution. These unit are readily available and easy to use. Personally, I use a Buffalo unit that contains dual two terabyte drives. The software in the unit mirrors the files to each drive. In this configuration, I have three copies of all my data, two copies on the NAS and one on my computer. The NAS unit will recover and rebuild the data if one of it's drives fail and you replace it with a new one. With Lightroom, it is critical to backup not only your images but you Lightroom catalog as well. In a default installation, the catalog will be a sub folder of your pictures folder. The folder will typically be called Lightroom "X" Catalog, the X will be the current version number. This folder should be copied as part of your backup strategy. Failure to do this will risk losing all your editing information, all the work you have done to make the images.

   <strong>Why is Lightroom called a parametric image editor?</strong> Truth be told I haven't been asked this many times but I wanted to answer it because it is an important concept in the understanding of how Lightroom works. Different from Photoshop, Lightroom does not require an image file before doing edits, and in fact will not create an image file until you export. Lightroom shows you a preview of how your image will look when is exported. The edits you execute in Lightroom are stored in the database as "parameters", during the export a new image file is create based on your original file and all the edits you made. This is one reason why it is critical to ensure that your Lightroom catalog is backed up every time you make edits.

   <strong>Will Lightroom ever change my raw file?</strong> No, Lightroom will never make any changes to your raw file. It will show you a preview of your raw file and include any edits you have completed. Think of edits as layers of clear acetate that you see your image through.

   <strong>Should I organize my image in folders or collections?</strong>  Images should be stored in folders on your hard drive in a structure that makes sense to you and allows you to easily back up your files. Lightroom's collection feature allows you to logically organize similar image in groups regardless of where they are on your hard drive. Example, if you typically shoot nature images you may store your files in folders that represent a photo trip. This trip may have included diverse types of wildlife. If on multiple trips you shoot images of bears, you may want all your bear images in one location. If you organize this in folders you will need to duplicate the file, storing it once in the trip folder and a second time in the bear folder. Instead you can use the collection feature to create a "bear" collection and store bear images from multiple trips in this same collection. Using this feature does not duplicate the image as one image can be included in many collections. Another use for collections to is to create one for a specific purpose, like club competitions. As you edit images if you see one that may be suitable for a comp you can simply place in the comp collection.

   <strong>What are virtual copies and how can I use them?</strong> Virtual copies allow you to have multiple versions of the same image. Colour, monochrome, different crops, different aspect ratios or perhaps just different renderings and local adjustments. Using virtual copies allows you to see different possibilities for your image by creating a new stack of acetate layers through which you view the same image. It is an excellent feature for exploring image potential.

   <strong>How should I expose my raw files in camera to maximize the capabilities of Lightroom?</strong>
   This is a complex topic and could easily be the subject of an entire article. To answer this question, we need to differentiate between exposures for raw and jpeg images. If you are shooting jpeg�s, the rendering will be done in camera, and you need to expose accordingly. You need to expose so that the histogram accurately represents your final image with retention of detail in the whites. Jpeg exposures should not be exposed to the right-hand side of the histogram. If your exposure is to right edge you will lose detail in the whites. Raw files, in contrast, should be exposed so that whites in the image are at the very right-hand edge of the histogram. Exposing in this manner will allow you to retain the maximum amount of data that your camera sensor can capture. In Lightroom, this right edge exposed raw file can be mapped down so that the white details are retained. Digital image files are a data capture and you want to have the highest quality of data for each image. When exposing to the right be careful that only the whites are at the right edge. If you have an image with no whites, you will not expose as far to the right.
